  <br><br><span class="fontII">In my childhood,</span> I tried to innovate things by destroying &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my little brother toys ! 
  <br>"I remember one time, I destroyed his brand new toy to make a train out of it, and he wasn't
  <br> happy with the result !" Every New Year eve, I had a habit of building a small airplane 
  <br> "from hard carton" that flies few meters by modifying a fire-works rocket that will fit into 
  <br> my design. I was 15 years old “in 1997” when I wrote my first program using the Basic language,
  <br> a language before visual basic, that was the first elementary school testing program in my town.
  <br>
  <br> <span class="fontII">My Habits:</span> I play soccer, chess, real time strategy pc game "Total War Series", poker, &
  <br> I love Music. I'm a very social person that I enjoy having conversation with others, meet new
  <br> people, and learn about different cultures. I have a lot of friends from all around the world !
  <br> Syria, America, Turkey, Iraq, India, Tunisia, China, Hong Kong, Germany, and Lebanon. 
  <br>
  <br> Also, I am interested in <span class="fontII">Robotics</span> that I am doing an individual/independent
  <br> study in designing & implementing a fully autonomous mining Robot
  <br> <a href="http://www.ufaggregator.com/"target="_blank" >"AggreGator"</a>, which will compete in NASA &nbsp;Robotic Ming Competition
